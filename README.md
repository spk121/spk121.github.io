This is documentation for Guile-GI.

For now, it is written in Texinfo.
Each file is a chapter, except for index.texi which holds the document structure.
If you add a new chapter, you need to add it as an include in index.texi.

The HTML rendering is in the docs directory.

There is a Github action that should automatically update the HTML rendering
whenever a commit is pushed to master.  It should also push the HTML output
to https://spk121.github.io
